        <p> My name is Robi Lovell and I've been teaching myself how to program for a few years now.  I started learing how to code by editing scripts on Second Life.  I had a blast doing it.  There was something really cool about taking an insipid object and breathing life into it.  From there I moved onto creating video game mods.  After a while I felt impeded by only being able to edit code that someone else had created.  I wanted to learn to compose my own. </p>

        <p> While dabbling in a few different languages, I discovered how awesome web development was.  I found some amazing tutorials by <i>TheNewBoston</i> on YouTube.  I completed his HTML, CSS, and JS video courses and moved on to other outlets like w3schools and SoloLearn.  Once I made it through those I decided to start a full stack development bootcamp to help me bridge the gap between self-teaching and being career ready.  I'm ecstatic to start this new chapter in my life and actually pursue a career in something Im truley passionate about.
